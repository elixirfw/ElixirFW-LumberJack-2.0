# ElixirFW-LumberJack-2.0
Fully configurable FiveM Advanced Lumberjack script for QBCore
Available here: https://elixirfw.tebex.io/package/SOON

# Info
We've developed Lumberjack 2.0, offering enhanced script configurability. You now have the flexibility to customize the script extensively, incorporating features such as random rewards during processing. Whether you prefer a target or 3D text, the choice is yours â€“ the script is fully configurable.

# Features
1. QBCore Compatibility: The script is designed to seamlessly integrate with QBCore.
2. Custom QBCore Rename: Enjoy the flexibility of customizing QBCore names through the script's configuration.
3. Full Configurability: The script offers comprehensive customization options, allowing users to tailor settings according to their preferences.
4. Open-Source and Encrypted: Choose between open-source and encrypted versions, providing flexibility and security.
5. Exclusive Tree Attachment: Prevent simultaneous tree attachment by implementing a feature that disallows multiple users from connecting to the same tree.
6. Target and 3D Text Interaction: Players can choose between using the Target system or traditional 3D Text for interactions.
7. Dynamic Tree Locations: Six tree locations with specific coordinates and status tracking prevent overlap during chopping.
8. Icons and Blips: Enhance the visual experience with icons for selling, processing, starting the job, and chopping wood.
9. Configurability: Highly configurable, allowing server administrators to customize spawn locations, ped models, blip settings, and more.
10. Item Rewards: Players have a chance to receive wood-cut items as rewards during the tree-chopping process.
11. Interact Sounds: Optional sound effects, such as a chainsaw sound, can be configured for a more immersive experience.
12. Poly Zone Boxes (Debug Mode): For debugging, the script includes a Target Debug Mode to visualize Poly Zone Boxes.
13. Fuel System Integration: Compatible with the LegacyFuel system.
